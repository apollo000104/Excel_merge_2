# Excel_merge_2
This is a simple code for beginner with pandas.
We can use "pandas.merge" function for merging 2 excel files.
there are 4 parameters and the most important is 'how' parameter.
You can see here the differ between 4 other case of 'how' parameter- inner, outer , left, right.

-left: The left merge will return all rows from the left DataFrame, and only the matching rows from the right DataFrame.
-right: The right merge will return all rows from the right DataFrame, and only the matching rows from the left DataFrame.
-inner: The inner merge will return only the rows that match in both DataFrames.
-outer: The outer merge will return all rows from both DataFrames, even if there are no matching rows in the other DataFrame.

I hope this explanation is helpful.
Thanks
